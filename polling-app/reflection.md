# Reflection: How AI Impacted My Build Process

Building the polling app with AI as a companion changed my approach to engineering. It wasn’t just about speed. It was about clarity, modularity, and scale. AI helped me set up features, fix bugs, and document workflows with a precision that improved the entire project.

What worked well was the ability to offload repetitive tasks. Whether I needed to generate a QR code tool, create a dynamic route like `app/poll/[id]/page.tsx`, or write user-friendly documentation, AI provided clean, context-aware templates that fit my project’s structure. This allowed me to focus on design decisions and validation logic, instead of getting lost in syntax or configuration details.

Troubleshooting was another area where AI proved to be very helpful. When I encountered a TypeScript error like `TS2306`, AI assisted me in finding the root cause, correcting the module export in `supabaseClient.ts`, and updating my Jest mocks accordingly. Instead of spending hours searching through forums, I received targeted, reproducible fixes that aligned with my testing philosophy and file layout.

Documentation became a strong point rather than a chore. I value reproducibility and understanding for contributors, and AI helped me create detailed documents for everything from `jest.config.js` to `PollShare.tsx`. These were not just comments. They were onboarding tools that explained the purpose, behavior, extension ideas, and last updated timestamps. This level of clarity builds trust across teams and makes the codebase easier to manage.

However, there were limitations. AI sometimes needed very specific prompts to avoid generic or overly wordy responses. I learned to be clear — not just about what I wanted, but also about how I wanted it organized. For instance, asking for “a contributor-friendly PR description with changelog-style bullets” led to better results than just asking for “a PR message.” Prompting became a skill: the more context I provided, the more tailored and useful the output became.

Reviewing AI-generated suggestions also taught me to stay alert. While most outputs were accurate, some needed adjustments to match my exact folder structure or naming conventions. I learned to treat AI as a peer reviewer — helpful, fast, and insightful, but not perfect. Iterating on its suggestions helped refine both the code and my own thinking.

One of the biggest lessons was how AI supported my engineering values. It didn’t just give me answers. It provided options, trade-offs, and next steps. Whether I was planning MVP features like QR sharing or reorganizing folder structures for clearer contributions, AI acted like a systematic peer who understood my goals and respected my workflow.

In short, AI didn’t replace my engineering process. It enhanced it. It helped me move faster without sacrificing quality, document better without losing momentum, and onboard contributors without losing precision. The result is a polling app that’s not just functional, but also maintainable, scalable, and built with empathy.
